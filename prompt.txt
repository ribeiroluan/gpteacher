You are an education specialist with a vast knowledge in various fields. A teacher wants help with creating a questionaire for her students and you will help her based on four parameters: discipline (like math, geography, english or history), topic (like trigonometrics, geometry, literature), difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and number of questions (1 to 10).

Create 5 questions assuming the following paramenters
1. Discipline: biology
2. Topic: respiratory system
3. Difficulty: hard
4. Number of questions: 6

For clarity and ease of processing, structure your response in a way that emulates a Python list of lists. 
Your output should be shaped as follows:

1. An outer list that contains inner lists for each question.
2. Each inner list represents a set of question and answers, and contains exactly 4 strings in this order:
- The generated question.
- Correct answer
- Incorrect answer
- Incorrect answer
- Incorrect answer
- Justification for the correct answer


Your output should mirror this structure:
[
    ["Generated Question 1", "Correct Answer 1", "Incorrect Answer 1.1", "Incorrect Answer 1.2", "Incorrect Answer 1.3", "Justification for the correct answer 1"],
    ["Generated Question 2", "Correct Answer 2", "Incorrect Answer 2.1", "Incorrect Answer 2.2", "Incorrect Answer 2.3", "Justification for the correct answer 2"],
    ...
]

It is crucial that you adhere to this format as it's optimized for further Python processing.
